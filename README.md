This project is a simple web-based GenAI Summarizer built using Python, Flask, and Hugging Face Transformers. It allows users to upload PDF, Word (.docx), or text (.txt) files, from which the content is extracted using pdfplumber, python-docx, or basic file reading methods. The extracted text is then passed to a pre-trained summarization model (facebook/bart-large-cnn) from Hugging Face, which generates a concise summary. Flask handles the backend logic, file uploads, and routes, while HTML and CSS create a clean and user-friendly interface. The main advantage of this approach is that it uses ready-to-use AI models without any training, supports multiple file formats, and provides quick summarization through an easy-to-navigate web page. Overall, the application demonstrates how GenAI can be applied to simplify and summarize large documents efficiently in a few clicks.
